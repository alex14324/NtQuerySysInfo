Introduction

NtQuerySystemInformation is a Windows Native API function that retrieves various types of system information, including details about running processes. It can provide low-level access to system data, making it a powerful tool for developers and security analysts.
Getting Started

To use NtQuerySystemInformation, you need:

    A Windows development environment (Visual Studio recommended)
    Basic knowledge of C or C++
    Windows SDK installed

Example Code
C++ Example

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how to enumerate processes using NtQuerySystemInformation:

#include <windows.h>

#include <iostream>

#include <vector>

typedef NTSTATUS (NTAPI *NtQuerySystemInformation_t)(
    SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS SystemInformationClass,
    PVOID SystemInformation,
    ULONG SystemInformationLength,
    PULONG ReturnLength
);

int main() {
    HMODULE ntdll = LoadLibraryA("ntdll.dll");
    NtQuerySystemInformation_t NtQuerySystemInformation =
        (NtQuerySystemInformation_t)GetProcAddress(ntdll, "NtQuerySystemInformation");

    ULONG bufferSize = 0x10000;
    std::vector<BYTE> buffer(bufferSize);
    ULONG returnLength;

    NTSTATUS status = NtQuerySystemInformation(SystemProcessInformation, buffer.data(), bufferSize, &returnLength);
    if (status == 0) { // STATUS_SUCCESS
        // Process the buffer to extract process information
        // (Parsing code would go here)
        std::cout << "Process enumeration successful!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cerr << "Failed to enumerate processes. NTSTATUS: " << status << std::endl;
    }

        Note: The code snippet requires further implementation to parse the buffer and extract meaningful process data.

Usage

    Compile the code in a Windows development environment.
    Run the executable to see the output of enumerated processes.
